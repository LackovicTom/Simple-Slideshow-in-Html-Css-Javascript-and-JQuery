#Simple Slideshow in HTLM CSS JAVASCRIPT AND JQUERY
This is a very simple *and surely optimizable* slideshow that I created from scratch but it does the job! : sweat_smile:
I often needed to make some for client sites so I decided to create this improvable foundation and save it somewhere.

##Features
-Automatic detection of the number of items in the slideshow
-Automatic addition of the number of navigable dots (for navigation)
-Control via dots / arrows with timer reset
-Animation of fadeIn
-Almost fully responsive * requires little adjustment to be 100% *
-No limit on the number of slides possible
-Each slide can be anything (and contain any html content)

##Installation 
1. Add HTML
1. Add CSS
1. Add JAVASCRIPT/JQUERY *version used: 3.6.0*

## Don't forget to update your path !
